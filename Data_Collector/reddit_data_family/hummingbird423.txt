How often should we visit parents?
My in-laws nag my husband and I about not visiting them often enough. My husband wants to visit more often but between trying to get everything else done on weekends and visit my family as well, we have no weekends left to ourselves or be social. 

His family lives over 2 hours away and we are expected on every visit to arrive Friday night and leave Sunday night. We go about every 6 weeks but we are also expected to go tent camping with them a couple times a year which I hate because the campgrounds are always in the middle of nowhere with no amenities (maybe a pond) and you sit around the campsite all day doing nothing. His grandparents aunts and uncles all live off the same road, so we generally see most of them each visit. And every other holiday for multiple days.

Meanwhile, his parents are upset that we don't come more often partly because we live a half hour from my parents. We see my parents more often yes ( at most every 3 weeks) but it's only ever for a couple hours at a time. My grandparents live an hour away so we make 1 day a month to see them. My other grandparent I visit about once a month but my husband only joins about half the time.

Any advice? How can I be reasonable to them but also respect my own time?
