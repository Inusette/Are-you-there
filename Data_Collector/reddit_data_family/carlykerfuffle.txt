Ain't my mom the best?
Today is Valentine's Day and I told my mom, about whom I've written on Reddit several times before, "Here's to my last one as a single woman!" 

I told her I have a personal deadline for my first kiss -- and unbeknownst to her, losing my virginity (August 28th, 2019, my 25th birthday) and she said "Maybe if you lose weight and care about your appearance guys will like you."

Gee, thanks mom. Bitch.

EDIT: Oh, it got better! Not even a half hour later, mom gave me a Valentine's Day card signed "Be kind to yourself today!" with a box of M&amp;Ms. How hypocritical!
