Where to meet estranged family? Somewhere public but where you can have a private conversation.
I have not seen my father or 2 half siblings in 10 years. We are planning a meet up, but I can’t figure out where we should meet. I want to be able to have a private conversation but have people around because I really don’t know him it’s basically like meeting a stranger. I also don’t know if the kids will get emotional. I don’t know if things are going to go good or bad so it needs to be somewhere I can leave immediately if I needed to.
