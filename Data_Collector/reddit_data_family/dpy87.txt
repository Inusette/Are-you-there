I convinced my friend to not go to a basketball game but I still went. Am I wrong?
So I haven't seen my friend in over 7 years since graduating college. I live in LA and he was staying nearby in Anaheim at a yoga retreat visiting from Florida. He wanted to go to a Lakers game this last week but for some reason I was hesitant.  I know he doesn't have it together and isn't a responsible adult so I had my doubts. Hasn't been working and no source of income.

He wasn't sure if he was gonna get a ride (doesn't have a car), he wanted me to buy his ticket in advance, never been to LA, and it was like 2 1/2 hours before the game. I was like man, I'm not dealing with this. I know I'll get there but you are on your own.

So I convinced him not to go saying it's too expensive and that you don't know the area. I still went but I didn't tell him so. I just think seeing a friend you haven't seen in years at a sporting event isn't the best place to bond or talk to especially last minute. Sometimes you just have to look out for yourself.
