Boyfriends dad
SO let me start by saying I respect everyone who I meet, especially family members because my family means a lot to me but my boyfriends dad keeps creeping me out. So for example this morning at 9 (my boyfriend left for work at 6 and I have the day off) he walking into the room (without knocking) and stood at the door and stared at me breathing really heavily. I was "asleep" under the covers with my head under aswell but he just stood there, he didn't move or go and get anything but after 1 minute of standing there (literally 1 minute) he went back downstairs and then five minutes after came back up and walked in again (without knocking) and stood at the end of my boyfriends bed moving things around. He then left but left the door wide open and he turned his tv up so loud. I checked today and he didn't take anything from my boyfriends room but my bra that I left on the side of the desk (was super tired and accidentally left it there last night) it had been moved.. that was the only thing that had been moved. He has done strange things like this before, he has watched porn so loudly in the house when it's only been me and him in the house, he once walked into my boyfriends room and for some reason touched my bum (on top of covers) but that might have been a mistake, he bitches about me and my boyfriend spending OUR OWN MONEY on takeouts and going to the cinema and he bitches to my boyfriends sister. It's annoying but now I retreat to my boyfriends bedroom all the time because he genuinely creeps me out. Am I being unreasonable please help me. I don't think my boyfriend would believe me or think that it's means anything. I am 20 and my boyfriends is 22 and I don't live with my boyfriend. But every time I am in my boyfriends room-by myself- he barges in without knocking. I just want privacy help please.
