Guilt when you don't want to be friends with someone
Most of my life, I've sort of accepted the friendship of people who chose me. Then I went through some stuff, started setting boundaries, and unloaded a few toxic relationships. My therapist encouraged me to actively choose people I want to be friends with, and I have some great friends, now! However, a recent situation came up where someone is circumstantially connected to me, and wants to be my friend, but I'm uncomfortable, and have had to withdraw and limit communication with the person. It's largely a poor personality fit. I have felt drained and disoriented when I'm around the person, and our values don't match up, which irritates me a lot. However, I feel really guilty about rejecting her friendship overtures. I know I'm doing the right thing, though.

What are your stories of learning to choose friends and passing on people who don't have the right vibe? Have you felt guilty?
