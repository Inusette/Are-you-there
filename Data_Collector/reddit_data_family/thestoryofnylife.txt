Are they real friends?
So I have a few friends and I am not sure whenever they actually are real friends. 
We have known each other since we were 6-7 years old, and I am soon going to be 21 years old, so well that’s a long long time we have known each other. I used to consider them friends, but a bit over a year ago I started doubting that. I started doubting that because when my older sister passed away and I was completely broken, they just disappeared, they never asked how I felt or anything like that, we were supposed to hang out shortly after my sister passed away, but naturally I cancelled, and then seemed annoyed with that, after that they just started talking about how they got a drivers licenses and so, I felt upset, no one really actually cared about what happened to me. Well 1 month went by and neither of them asked how I was doing, 1 more month passed and still no one asked. After that we met up and they talked like nothing ever happened, when I started to talk a bit about how I felt, they just ignored it and turned to another topic. I do realise some people don’t like to talk about sad stuff because they don’t know what to say, but still we have known each other for so many years, but never once did they ask how I was doing, it hurt me tbh. 
Well I kept hanging out with them and more time passed, And I got a boyfriend, neither of them ever had a boyfriend and neither did I before. Well anyway I told them I had a boyfriend now, they seemed uninterested, which was fine. 
Well now over a year after I started dating him (we are still dating) they pretend like I am not in a relationship. Every time we talk about relationships someone says, I wonder which one of us will be in a relationship first, and I go, I am already in one, and then someone says, yeah oh that right, sorry I forgot. How do they forget? They follow me on Instagram and there are many couple photos of us, and they liked every single photo. 
So lately I asked myself, are they really friends?
