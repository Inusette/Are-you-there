does my friend actually care about me
I have this friend I've known for over a year, we're inseparable and have been best friends ever since we met. She's bisexual and has admitted to liking me twice, but I didn't mind. I won't date her though, I'm straight. 

I like her stepbrother, and she knows. Sometimes I feel she is playing mind games with me because she is upset about that...?

She says "He likes you."

and then the next day says he is "Bisexual" and likes some guy.

Then she says "He is breaking up with his girlfriend and asking you out." 

and she says the bi thing again. I feel like if she really cared about my feelings she wouldn't try to crush them by saying things like that.

Also, whenever I talk about him she says "Ew."

:( what is her deal?
