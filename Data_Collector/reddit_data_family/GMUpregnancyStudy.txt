Seeking Pregnant Working Women for Paid Research Study
Hi! I am a working mom and Psychology researcher from George Mason University conducting a study on how pregnant women navigate the workplace. If you are currently pregnant, working at least 20 hours, and have not disclosed your pregnancy to your supervisor, you are eligible to participate in the study! Please visit this following site for more information. Compensation includes $40 in Amazon giftcards and chance in raffle for an iPad. If you know of anyone else who may be eligible, please spread the word. We can't do this important research without you! https://sites.google.com/site/cheungdiversitylab/pregnancy-and-the-workplace
