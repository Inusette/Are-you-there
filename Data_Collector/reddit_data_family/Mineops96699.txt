Don't know if this person wants to be friends or not.
I met this friend two years ago and we were really great friends for a small while. I was really excited to meet someone as great as she is, but I think I pushed it a little bit and made her uncomfortable. I stopped talking with her since because I do not want to harass her. Recently, she has been trying to talk to me and offer me food in school and greeting me almost everyday to try to get my attention. I decided to text her yet she barely responds and also left me on read. I remember that she is not good at keeping up with texts and would often be busy with somethings. I admit it, sometimes I leave people on read for days and forget about them and just think back like "Oh, that person has sent me that message, I'll read it later" and then just put it off. As I was saying, does the fact her ignoring my texts like that prove that she doesn't care about me or am I just overthinking things? What should I do to become friends with her again because I really missed her? Thanks a bunch in advance! :)
