Are there days, you just don't wanna deal with your friends shit?
You don't wanna listen to the way your friend speaks, his opinions or anything about him. It's not like you hate him or anything, it's just... I don't wanna deal/listen to your shit right now.

The entire problem probably just isn't with your friend, you just don't wanna speak to them.
