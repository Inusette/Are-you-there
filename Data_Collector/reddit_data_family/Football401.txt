Best friend disagrees with my decision
I recently just bought a vaping device, and my friend shamed me for it. He is the leader of my friend group, and all my other friends are starting to follow him. I can understand why he is upset, as we have been friends forever and he did not think I would do something like this. However, he is hypocritical. He has used this device almost as much as I have (another common friend has one), as well as gotten drunk, and has talked about wanting to smoke weed on numerous occasions. 

What bugs me the most is that when some of our other friends own something like this, he doesn’t seem to care the slightest bit. By him turning people against me, I fear that I will be frowned upon by my friends. I get where’s he coming from, but he’s not taking some things into consideration, as well as not accepting that is MY OWN choice.

I have another friend who supported me, and from what I’ve heard from him, they are treating him unfairly.

In terms of the vaping device, my plan all along was to not let myself get addicted to the nicotine content. Maybe he is afraid I will be addicted and change as a person and stop hanging out with him (even though he barely even talks to me at school anymore, even before this whole situation). 

I know that I will not change as a person, and I’m not getting rid of the device. I know that this is my own choice, and I will do whatever needs to happen if it starts to affect me in a negative way. My main problem is handling this difficult situation with my best friend along with my other friends. And help would be much appreciated.
