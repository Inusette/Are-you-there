Crazy how you have to put an insane amount of work to be somewhat acceptable
Lately ive been going to school just to sit for 3 months and my grades flunked because ive been living with the mentality that i will kill my self. Now i sort of want pick up because right now im a disgrace in the eyes of my family. I tend to think of the future a lot so i picture the day that all my grades are good but im still stuck with misery and me realizing how ive put an insane amount of energy just to keep those around me happy. Thoughts like these is the reason why im a failure.
