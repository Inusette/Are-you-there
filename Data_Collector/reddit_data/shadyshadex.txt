The King That Never Was
Once upon a time, in a village unknown. There lived two brothers, Kain and Leba. 

Kain was a smart and ambitious young farmer. He was also hardworking, and aspired to become a great ruler.

Unlike Kain, Leba loved to fish. Leba was always seen laying by the creek. He was known to be good at nothing, yet he never seemed to be bothered by it.


As the new season started, Kain brought forth a basket of figs as a gift to the Village Chief.

**"The finest of the village! The finest of my harvests! The finest of figs!"**

**"Hmm. Very Well!"** The Village Chief replied.

But Leba was nowhere to be seen, as he continued fishing by the creek.


The next season, Kain arrived with a basket of olives.

**"The finest of the village! The finest of my harvests! The finest of olives!"**

**"Hmm. Very Well!"** The Village Chief replied.

But Leba was still nowhere to be seen, as he continued fishing by the creek.


The next season came. However, Kain was much more exited this time.

**"The finest of all fruits! The finest of my harvests! The finest of apples! All for you, great Village Chief!"**

**"Hmm. Very Well!"** The Village Chief replied.

Yet Leba was still nowhere to be seen, as he continued to fish by the creek.


*Kain dashed out of the village to seek Leba.*

**"O Brother you're a fool, can't you stop doing nothing? You have brought nothing but shame to me!"** Kain exclaimed.

And to this Leba shook his head and replied:

**"Kain, your hard work has brought smile to the villagers. However has your hard work ever gave you a glimpse of happiness?"**

Now furious, Kain exclaimed:

**"I will be happier than you have ever been Leba! Be gone before you shame me even more."**

And so Leba left the village, exiled from his brother's mind. Yet no one questioned Leba's whereabouts.


Soon, Kain was appointed as the new Village Chief.

Yet he still felt empty...

A darkness that was **enveloping** him...

**"Oh Village Chief! You have the blessings of the villagers, you surely must be happy!" said the village advisor.**

Kain smiled. 

The darkness then retreated.


*Months became years and Kain started to think of his brother.*

**Knock Knock**

Kain turned the knob, relieved to see his brother Leba standing strong and healthy.

**"Oh brother I have missed you so! Have you come to your senses yet Leba?"** questioned Kain.

And to this Leba shook his head and replied:

**"Kain, your hard work has brought prosperity to the village. However has your hard work ever gave you a glimpse of happiness?"**

Now furious, Kain exclaimed:

**"I will be happier than you have ever been Leba!"** He slammed Leba against the concrete wall, then dragged and imprisoned Leba in his room.


Soon, the village flourished and became a bustling town under Kain's management. 

Yet he still felt empty...

A darkness that was **engulfing** him...

**"Oh Mighty Ruler! You have the blessings of the many other kings, you surely must be happy!"** said his advisor.

Kain smiled. The darkness then retreated.





*Months became years and Kain started to think of his brother again.*

And so, Kain went to visit Leba.

**"Oh brother forgive me please! Have you come to your senses yet?"** Kain pleaded.

And to this Leba replied:

**"Kain, your hard work has brought gold and riches to our home. However has your hard work ever gave us a glimpse of happiness?"**

Now enraged, Kain unsheathed a dagger from under his robe and thrust it through Leba's heart.

Leba fell, slowly yet calmly.

Peering at the mirror beside him, Kain saw it for the first time. 

His own smile.

His own cold limp body. Lifeless, yet liberated.


**"I will be happier than you have ever been Leba! Be gone, away from my mind!"** Kain whimpered while wallowing in his tears.


*Minutes became hours, and soon Kain laid on his bed, a dying old man.*

Yet he still felt empty...

A darkness that was **gripping** him...

In desperation, Kain's advisor called forth the kingdom's greatest priest.



**"Oh Priest pity me so... My death is near, and I feel so empty..."** Kain gasped.

The Priest took hold of Kain's hands and proudly exclaimed:

**"Oh Mighty King! You have even the blessings of our Almighty God! How blessed your life must be!"**

But this time, the darkness didn't stop.

It started to **Swirl...**

It started to **Twirl...**

**Dancing** around Kain with opened jaws.

As Kain drew his last breath, he wondered:

**"Why did I lose myself?"**

**Munch Munch, Chomp Chomp, Gobble Gobble, Gulp**

Hello guys, I'm sorry that I posted this story without explaining myself at the start. I figured that writing a simple story like this would make it easier for people to understand. I've told my friends and family about my feelings, about my sadness. Yet all they did was shrug it off and said it was nothing and everyone feels sad at some point. Writing this story, it sort of lifted a burden from my chest. Its the first time I have ever materialised my thoughts and emotions. Although I'm admittedly not a good writer, I feel that I just need some form of release and support now.

Thank you for taking the time to read through my ramble. Have a nice day.
