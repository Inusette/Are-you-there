Feel like I'm going to die never having a girlfriend
I'm 20 right now, in college, where basically everyone is in a relationship, and can hop in and out of them like they're nothing. But for me, I'm afraid I will never experience what its like to be loved by someone and it's only gonna get harder after college. I've never even had a kiss yet.

Even on reddit, shy guys get into relationships because girls approach them and ask them out, literally. But if you look like me, you'll realize that no girl would ever think you are attractive. It's one thing to be shy, but its another thing to be unfortunate-looking, and I was born with the worst case outcome on both. I even try to put in effort into my own appearance, as staying at a perfect weight, dressing nicely, doing my hair, and working out (almost have abs even), but I haven't gotten any girls to want me yet.

I also put myself out there too. I've tried different student clubs/interest groups and tried to integrate myself with them, but I still don't feel wanted. Even on Tinder and OKCupid, I struggle really badly on them, I only get maybe 3-4 matches a week on tinder, which is abysmal. 

Granted, I am a little anxious around women, but other women see social anxiety in men as adorable, cute, or at the very least, a positive trait. But in me, it's like they think I'm not worthy of being considered a man.
