Just saw a video that made me realise something.
The video was a compilation of a bunch of friends spending a weekend together.

It wasn't one of those scripted things. It was raw footage that was just cut to a seven-minute-video.

Aftet seeing it, I realised something: I will never experience something like that. 
Grouping up with your friends and having fun together like that.

To make it worse, I can hear people planning stuff *together* at my school.

How they will meet after school/the next weekend and do something fun *together*.
Also social media.

My life instead is a cycle. Nothing new happens and I keep repeating the same scheduled things every single day.

Wake up.
Go to school.
Come home.
Go to work.
Come home.
Study.
Sleep.

During weekends,  replace school with studying/work. I haven't visited anyone in the past 3.5 years.

Why can't I be like those guys in that video? Why can't I be in any group?
Why do I have to have severe social anxiety?

This is just..... stupid.
