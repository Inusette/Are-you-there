Too ugly for friends or anything more.
I'm 22 in uni, and nobody wants to talk to me, much less be friends or anything more. I hear people say, "you gotta talk to them first", but why the hell do i always have to do that? it doesn't work, first of all, at least not for me, and why can't somebody else want to initiate a conversation? why me? 

we live in a society where people care so much about looks. if you are ugly, that's just too bad. i don't think a girl finds me attractive.i wouldn't know anyways since no one wants to talk to me. they say, there's more to it than looks, there's character/personality, but if no one is willing to talk to you and be friends, how are we supposed to do anything more?

im just tired of going through the motions everyday, wake up , go to school, work long hours on assignments, etc. can't talk to anybody, like who wants to be friends with someone very ugly anyways? just ignore them and they'll go away

i am hating people more and more everyday, and i just wish i would die soon so i don't have to put up with this miserable excuse of a 'life'.
