My mom doesn't understand that I use the internet as my coping mechanism.
I've posted before in either this subreddit or others about how my family can't understand that my internet is how I cope with my depression but now it's actually becoming a bigger problem. I'm 14 and I've been depressed for about 3-4 years. In that time, I've had a therapist but the therapist didn't help me. At this point, my only coping mechanism is the internet and music. I stay up until about 3 in the morning no matter what, internet or not. My mom has turned off our router at like 11pm but I still stay awake cause I just can't sleep. She's also taken my phone away before with no internet but I stay awake just thinking about life, people, and other shit for hours. Everytime she does this, I just feel 10x more depressed and I sleep at the same time either way. Music is my coping mechanism and I would probably have no motivation or anything without it. What the fuck should I do?
