I want to stop being myself
I don’t know who i am without depression and I try to be someone who’s very bright and undeterred, the complete opposite of who I feel to maybe try to balance it out. Maybe if I lie long enough it’ll become true. But it feels like when I come home I take off that mask and all of my ugliness and anger and saddness are bleeding out. 

I hate being myself I try to be someone else but it’s not helping. I don’t remember how to be the person I was before depression and anxiety took over my life, I don’t remember how to be happy anymore.
