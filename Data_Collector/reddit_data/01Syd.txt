Best moment to have anxiety
It's 3:30am, I'm tired, want to get up early, and guess what ? My brain decided this : Instead of sleeping, why don't you become half crazy, thinking about your future (should I say the "lack" of future ?). Here, have some cravings for cigarettes, my pleasure, and of course i know you don't have cigarettes, do you think I'm stupid ? The middle of the night is the best moment for thinking of smoking when you can't smoke. 

Think of your loneliness.
Think of you inexistant social life. 
You are 25 and you have no job.
You are living with your boring mother, with whom you literally quarel with every day. 
She probably think you are a piece of shit. 
You never had any girlfriend, and you probably won't. Almost 26, don't count on me to congratulate you...

Your only sunbeam will be at New year's Eve, when you will travel to see your best friends. But guess what, since you have no money at all, you probably will have to work to sell fu***ng pastries, and because of that you won't be able to see your friends. 

Then you'll continue to argue with your mother. 
Living on the couch. 
Selling pastries. 
In entire loneliness.  
God only knows how long. 

The funny thing (say my brain) is this : "you are a loser, you lived and worked on your own not so long ago. But you are a child, you have the power to do what you want, where you want. You're 25, for God's sake, so why don't you move your ass ?"

Leave me alone brain, I already know all that. I would be a king if I could. But I won't. Funny how despair can suck the marrow of your life, how even when you are ready to fall in the deepest pit, you have absolutely no will to catch the rope. 

TL ; DR : FML.

Have a good day/night everyone !
