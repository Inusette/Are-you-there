Screening on Thursday, Oxford UK
Hi all, sorry if this is the wrong place to ask but I need some advice. About 3 weeks ago my wife [42] noticed that her left breast was getting larger than the other. After a quick visit to the doctor, who found a number of lumps, she has been referred to the Churchill for screening. It’s become really obvious over the last few weeks. 
We started measuring and it’s getting bigger by about an inch a week. 

My questions are
1. What should we expect on Thursday? She’s not letting come into the room with her. 
2. What should / could I do to support her? 

Thanks
