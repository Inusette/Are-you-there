My Mom was just diagnosed
I don't really know where else to go with this. 
My mom finally went to the doctor after experiencing fatigue, chest pain, and bronchitis that just wouldn't go away.
Initially, the doc found a small cancerous tumor in her breast and the lymph node near her armpit. She walked out with a Stage 2b diagnosis. She mentioned the chest pain, so they ordered a pet scan and found a small tumor just near her breast bone.
 She didn't tell me if it was in her bone or lymph node. It's hard to get her to be honest about what the doctors are saying. She's trying to protect me and my sister.
 My Dad has been obsessively Googling cancer lifespans and assumes its spread to her bone and that she has Stage 4. He says she has years, not decades. He isn't sleeping, and his behavior worries me more than my Mom's.
My real questions are: is it possible that the pet scan could have just found the other tumor in her chest was  in her lymph node, not her bone?
Will stage 4 really give me less than five years with my mom?
She's my person and the idea of not having her hurts too much.
How can I support my family without making them feel insulted or weak?
Sorry for the rambling. I have no idea how to talk about this with friends and needed to spill it somewhere.
