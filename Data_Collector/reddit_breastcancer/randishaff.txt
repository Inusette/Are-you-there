Mastectomy or lumpectomy? How did you decide?
34, found a lump in right breast in March, mammogram &amp; ultrasound 4/23, biopsy 4/27, Dx 5/1.  Stage IIa invasive carcinoma, no lymph nodes affected, 21mm, ER+/PR+, HER2-, CHK2 mutation.  

Its been about a month since I went in and discussed treatment options with my team - surgeon, oncologist, and radiologist. All indicated that the lumpectomy with radiation was the standard of care that they recommended, but I'm terrified of the radiation process.  I honestly can't read anymore blog posts or studies - it's too overwhelming.  So now I'm here asking others who've been through this - how did you decide what to do?
