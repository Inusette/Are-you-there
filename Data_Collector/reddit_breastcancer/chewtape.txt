BRCA and PGD
Hi,  

I am BRCA+ and my husband and I are starting to talk about having kids. We do not have any infertility problems (that we know about) but have met with an IVF doctor to discuss PGD (pre-implementation genetic diagnosis, where if you do IVF they can look at the embryos and pick ones that don't have the mutation). We are trying to decide whether to move forward with it and I'm wondering if anyone else has gone through this decision, and what factors you considered.  

Thanks in advance.
