32, waiting for my ultrasound. Need some support
Like many posts on here, I am waiting for my ultrasound. I found a small lump two weeks ago while randomly feeling my breasts, and my doctor confirmed it was about 1cm. Told me not to worry, but is sending me for an ultrasound. The breast centre at the hospital near my office is wonderful, but it also means I have to wait until May 25. My doc has booked my results follow up for June 4th so all in all, It'll be a month before I know anything definite!!! 

I am lucky to live in Canada, and Toronto specifically which has amazing  hospitals, but The wait is awful, but I am trying to keep myself busy and active so I don't sit here and think of it. Just wanted to vent my fears in hopes of finding people going through the same waiting game.
