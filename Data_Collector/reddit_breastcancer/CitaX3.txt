Close friend diagnosed today. How do I help her?
So, one of my best friends has just been diagnosed and is due to have her breast removed followed by chemo. I don't know what type or anything further except she had her mammogram and 5 samples taken on Monday, after her nipple inverted and was called in today. She's just turned 50 and has an almost 9 year old.

How can I help her? What helped you? I've said I'll support her with her appointments and come with her if she needs me. I don't want to bombard her with questions at the moment. I was thinking of cooking her a few of her favourite meals for the freezer or going round to clean, I already have a key anyway. Is there anything that really helps or doesn't help?

Thank you in advance.
