Early signs of breastcancer or related
I'm dealing with a harmless looking pain under my armpit for more than 8 months, one doctor checked it by hand and in that day it wasn't painful so the doctor said it's nothing.
Few months later I occasionally had a stinging pain under my armpit and a bump, is this already an alarm? 
Would like to hear similar experience
I'm planning to go to different doctor and ask for ultrasound and mammogram
