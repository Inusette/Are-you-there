Young female with family history
Recently I noticed changes in my left breast. I've had lumps before and had an exam many moons ago. There's a knot in my left breast where I also noticed a rash like circle under the breast and nipples are scaly. I looked up those exact symptoms and it lead to breast cancer pages. My aunt (father's sister) died at 35 of breast cancer. I qualified for an early detection program but now they're telling me I can't be seen because I'm not 50+ in age. Yet I have an immediate family member that died from it.... literally makes no sense and having this uncertainty is really messing with my emotions. Can anyone provide information on where I can go to get checked that I can qualify for being a broke joke.. I have absolutely no money to my name and no relationship with my family. Me against the world..... 

Please and thank you in advance for any stranger's kind help!!!!!
