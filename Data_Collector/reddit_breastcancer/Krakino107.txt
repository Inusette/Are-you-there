My GF was diagnosed today
She had biopsy two weeks ago because of some bulp in the breast. Today results are that is malign mucosse adenocarcinoma ER+ PR+. The surgery would be done Monday next week, Friday she will have meeting with the oncologist, I hope I will be able to go with her. Suggestion is that there will be radio and hormonal therapy. What should we expect? She should start new job on 1st August, but now no idea how long she will be recovering. The prognose seems pretty good but still its a hard news. She is 27.
