Ultrasound/Biopsy Friday
I'm 28 and I found a lump on my right breast Saturday and obviously my brain has been on the hamster wheel ever since.

I'm currently breastfeeding and have experienced clogged ducts and mastitis before but this doesn't feel like either. The lump almost feels like its in my muscle and its not able to move. I have no pain associated with it. No family history of BC and no other symptom except for an observation (by the doctor) that my saline implant was more into my armpit than my left. 

The doctor ordered for an ultrasound/other imaging along with biopsy if needed but since I'm breastfeeding I can't get a mammogram.
The waiting game sucks and my brain is going there and it just sucks because I have 2 kids.


UPDATE:
My results finally came back and I have extremely dense breast tissue therefore they could not see anything during the ultrasound. The doctor recommended that I stop breastfeeding and get a mammogram in 3 months after my supply dries up.
I of course read up on extremely dense breast tissue and 3 months just seems too far away
