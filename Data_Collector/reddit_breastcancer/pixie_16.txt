Lymphedema in arm: operation or not?
Hi there,

It's been 10 years since I discovered I had breast cancer (right breast, not metastasized). Had a breast amputation, chemo, radiation and 2 y later a breast reconstruction with belly tissue and belly fat.
Since 7y ago I developed lymphedema in my right arm. I have physical therapy 2x/ week, wear an arm sleeve (but am not always consistent, not so easy always to endure it), and try to avoid strenuous exercise for the right arm or lifting too heavy stuff.
But I still have a difference in circumference of 9 cm between both arms. And it hurts bad some days, to the point I can't sleep or feel my fingers. 

I heard of an new kind of operation performed where I live (Belgium), where they connect the "ducts" (don't know the right word) that transfer the lymphe fluid to a blood vessel in your arm so that the fluid can evacuate from your arm. 
But I can't seem to find much people who already had this kind of surgery...
Maybe anybody here has had this operation or knows someone who has? I'd love to know how that went and if they had improvement?

Greetings from Belgium x
