Incompetent office staff
Is it just me or do doctors offices seem to be staffed by incompetent or just uncaring staff these days.  I know I"m generalizing and there are exceptions, but we have not been doing well lately.  

My wife has stage IV metastatic breast cancer that has spread to six vertebrae, her right hip, and her liver.  She has been given a terminal diagnosis and are just buying time.  We like her oncologist, but the staff are really starting to piss me off.  I just had to read them the riot act.  For the fourth time in the last few months we have called in because of issues she's been having.   Dizziness, fever, whatever.  We have to leave a message around 9am because they are so busy.  Then the nurse does not listen to the messages till after 5pm when it's too late to do anything.  They MAYBE call us back the next day anywhere from 9 am to 5pm and say they will talk to the doctor.  Then nothing.  This is bullshit.  We called on Tuesday and left a message.  We called back on Wednesday and they said they would talk to the doctor.  We called back on Thursday and had to leave another message, but heard nothing.  This morning I started blowing up their phones at 9am.  A nurse and a office manager were informed of just how annoyed I was and how unacceptable this was.

If you work for a oncologist anything less than your first rate "A" game is unacceptable.   If I don't do my job for 48 hours you won't have your email.  If they don't do their job for 48 hours someone could die.   If I call in because my on chemo cancer patient wife is running a low grade fever this is not something you can put off for 3 to 5 days.  Twenty four hours is the MOST I would find acceptable.   It could be nothing, or it could kill her.
