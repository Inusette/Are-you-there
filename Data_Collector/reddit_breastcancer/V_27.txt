Advice on axillary mass with negative ultrasound findings
I just completed an ultrasound for my right breast and left axilla. My right breast is a cup size larger than my left as of a few months ago and extremely firm. My gp noted a couple areas she felt lumps. My left axilla has had a mass for over a year that has recently grown larger. My gp said it felt like scar tissue. To me it seems like a mass of lymph nodes that's pretty dang palpable. 
My ultrasound apparently showed nothing for both my breast and axilla. I'm relieved, but also really confused as I very clearly have a mass in my axilla. But because they saw nothing on my ultrasound, they said a mammogram wasn't necessary. 
Do I just let it go and deal with the mass? Talk to my gp again? I'm not sure where to go from here.
