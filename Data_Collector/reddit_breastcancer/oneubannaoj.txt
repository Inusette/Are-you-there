I’ve been experiencing pain on my on of my nipples
This past Thursday I noticed my right boob had been hurting and the next day the pain felt unbearable. I was in the dressing room and I saw I had a bump on my nipple that looked like if you popped it puss would come out. My sister suggested it was either an in ingrown hair or it was infected since I previously had my nipples pierced except I closed it a little over 2 months ago. She tried to pop it but it hurt and then the pain came back but even worse this time. I couldn’t get up because it hurt too much to move. The next day it didn’t hurt as much but I noticed it was red all around the nipple area. I put neosporin on it for a couple days but now it doesn’t look like the bump is ready to pop and the texture of my nipple looks different. I’m getting checked this Tuesday as soon as I get paid but I did want a second opinion. I don’t want to assume the worst and i apologize if this is in the wrong forum topic but I’m getting worried now. This photo is from today.
