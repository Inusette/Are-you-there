I'm translating this with google translate, hope it works...

The left breast showed a hypoechoic fusiform lesion of 8.6x4 mm in depth at 6 mm depth from the skin at 8 cm distance from the marginal edge of the areola, with smooth contour and no significant vascularity in the RDUS

also

Left axillary zone, 10x5 mm, fat hilus, lymph node in reactive character present...

What do you think? I'm really worried.
