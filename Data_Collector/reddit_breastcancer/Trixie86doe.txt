scared and alone
Hello everyone! Little background I'm a 31 year old mom of 2 small boys, no immediate family history of breast cancer. I found a lump in my right breast sometime in mid April, but it was close to my period so I left it alone, fast forward to the week after my cycle and it was still there, so I made an appointment with my obgyn to see what he thought. This morning was the appointment. He told me it was nothing to worry about but then asked if he could remove the fluid with a needle to check the color. Well I said yes, and no fluid came out, just little pieces of tissue that he put on a slide, he punctured it several times. So reading up, I'm seeing that cysts are fluid filled and tumors are not. I'm just super worried too because he said if it was a cyst that it would go away with the aspiration and the lump is still there. Any advice would be appreciated.
