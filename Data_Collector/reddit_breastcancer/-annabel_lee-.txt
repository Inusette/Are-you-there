Has anyone have any experience in going through breast cancer alone? 

I am basically a single mom of two young kids.  No family, no friends.   For the past couple of months my left nipple has been discharging blood.   I also have notice dimpling and a change in texture and thickness of skin.   For the last week, that breast has become swollen and hot.   

I'm terrified of going to get it checked out because if I do have something I will literally have no one to go through this with.   Any advice or even kind words would be appreciated.
