1 positive node (macro) is that considered M0 or M1?
If your nodes are positive (so far we only know 1 is, but more need to be taken out and tested) does that mean you have M1 status for staging purposes? I'm trying to figure out if a macrometastes in the sentinel node makes her Stage IV. 

P.S. Our docs are cagey about staging, which is why I don't have a straight answer from them. Her actual path report says she is T3 N1A and just doesn't say about the M status.
