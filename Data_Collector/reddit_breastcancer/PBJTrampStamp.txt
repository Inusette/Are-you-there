Biopsy coming up
I've been getting breast ultrasounds for the past year and a half due to finding a lump (which turned out to be lumps). Until recently it has felt like my doctor just taking precautions, but based on the new ultrasound they want to do a biopsy. I was just hoping that someone in this sub could tell me what to expect of the biopsy process and possibly help calm some of my fears.
Thanks
