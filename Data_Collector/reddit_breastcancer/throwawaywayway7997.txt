23. Aspiring career in surgical field. Fine motor movements after double mastectomy?
I have lost 2 women in my immediate family to breast/ovarian cancer (one diagnosed mid-late twenties, died a decade later), my mom is a breast cancer survivor, and all the other women in my immediate family have had preventative procedures. Many/most tested positive for BRCA gene. I'm the youngest woman in the family. I'm about to enter school with a high debt and 4 years of training to do a job in surgical field highly related to use of arms+fine motor skills of hands. Its a very physical job. If I dont have the surgery now and I decide to have it after taking on debt and schooling the next time I could have the surgery would be right after graduation, when I'm 28. Have any women had trouble, after the initial healing phase of a double mastectomy, with being able to hold arms upright or use hands for intricate things for long periods of time? I have the ability to change my career now (would not be able to change later) if I have the surgery now and have problems, but this surgery is much earlier than I wanted to have it and it would all be preventative. Is this an outcome of the surgery I should be worried about?
