Lump, nipple discharge, already had ultrasound &amp; nervous
Hello all,

I had a sort of red mark on my breast a few days ago, and a lump. I decided I should get it checked out, particularly since I’ve had some nipple discharge (yellow brownish) and some weird changes in my period and a family history plus some risk factors. My doctor swabbed the fluid and ordered an ultrasound which I’ve now had. It’s not fluid filled like a cyst or abscess but the radiologist said he thought that although there was heterogeneity in the lump he still thought it was most likely a fibroadenoma but that I need to follow up with a clinician who deals specifically with “lumps and bumps.” Ultimately I was told to wait for the formal report Tuesday. I missed a call a few hours after the ultrasound from my primary care doctor; I’m assuming, in my nervous mind, that the swab wasn’t bacterial and instead was for cytology and she has the results. Left voicemail asking that I call the office but it was too late to call back. I’m just still nervous despite the radiologist’s comment. Anyone have a similar experience?
