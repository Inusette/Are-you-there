Stage 2 Survivor Looking for Feedback!
Hello Everyone!

I am a Stage 2 Triple Negative Breast Cancer Survivor and I'm interested in giving speeches and starting in person support groups in my area and would LOVE all the feedback I can get so that I address the cancer topic\(s\)correctly.. I am becoming more and more aware of misconceptions of people that are newly diagnosed, currently in treatment, and are post treatment... If you would be so kind to private message me or comment your answers to the following questions I'd be eternally grateful.

1. What are the top three things that people say to you when the find out that you have cancer that you find/found annoying?
2. What were the top three things that were funny to you \(and maybe nobody else \) during treatment?
3. What are the top three misconceptions people have about you post treatment?
4. And for the caregivers of those that fought the brave battles but didn't make it...what would be the top three things that they would want us to know about their journey.

I realize these topics can and will be uncomfortable to share and I will feel extraordinarily blessed for those that feel that they can.

I want to be able to speak to and advocate for those that don't feel comfortable speaking out but want the message to be shared with those that will appreciate it.

Feel free to comment below or email me anytime: nadinelake1@gmail.com

Love to all
