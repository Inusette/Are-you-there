scared for my friend, possible cancer? need advice
heya guys, can’t seem to find any images online that look like what she has. we’re going to the doctor in the next couple days but it seems to be panic attack after panic attack. 
she’s 22 and in good health, but with very possible PCOS that is getting a checkup. 
it’s a small, pea sized bump on her breast, left side, near the armpit. it’s red bc she’s tried to squeeze it to see if it’s a cyst, which she gets often in other places around. it seems hard, and almost rooted in. she can move it, it’s just ... there. can not find any similar pictures online. 
NO PAIN, no swelling, no other symptoms except it being there. it’s been over 6 months since it’s appeared with no changes. could it be a cyst or something else? will update when we go to the docs but i just wanna give her some semblance of peace from people who’ve gone through this. don’t know if this post is ok to make, but god we appreciate it if you have any information. thank you
