CT tomorrow
Diagnosed with ER and PR + HER2 -  February. Underwent double mastectomy in March. Invasive ductal carcinoma with one positive lymph node on the left. Incidental DCIS on the right side. Currently on cycle 3 of 8 chemo.  CHEK2 gene mutation. CT tomorrow to look at lung granuloma and I'm terrified. 

I just need to throw it out there because, well, I'm terrified.
