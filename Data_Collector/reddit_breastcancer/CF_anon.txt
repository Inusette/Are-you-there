Have Appt...just need reassurance about symptoms
Hi, all. I'm 28. I was back in my home state and noticed that for 2 days my left nipple would not stop itching. It did stop after 2 days, and I went back home - I noticed 3 days ago (would have been about 2 days after the itching) that I had a small pink/red (pimple-size but not raised) on the very edge of my areola on my left boob.

It looks like a bug bite, but again, it's not raised. There's no rash, my skin does not feel hot, the texture is normal. The business I work for is in my home state, which neighbors the current state I live in now. We have to visit every month, and my health insurance is still in my home state, so I have to drive 4 hours for appointments. I made an appointment already with my doctor, but I just didn't know if I am freaking out over this, or if I should legit still see a doctor. The spot seems like it's faded by 20% in the last 2 days. 

Help!
