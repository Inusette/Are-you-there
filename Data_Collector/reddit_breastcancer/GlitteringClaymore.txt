Showing symptoms and getting worried...
Hi loves, recently I've noticed some symptoms recently and it's got me worried. 
I do not feel lumps, but both breasts are constantly red and itchy. When I itch them they start to bleed. 
I have a dry patch between my breasts that looks brownish and scaly, and sometimes burns. As for my entire breasts themselves, they do not get sore unless I itch them.

Is this something to worry about or am I just being paranoid about a small problem?
