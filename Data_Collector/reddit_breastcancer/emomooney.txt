My mother is having a double mastectomy on Thursday, and I need to know what to expect? How do I take care of her.
Hi. 

So, I found this out yesterday, I'm pretty poor at emotions and the like. So I mostly just shut down. I feel selfish. I am pretty scared. So far we don't really know anything, just that she has surgery on Thursday and will probably be home by Sat, and then we wait two weeks for results from that before knowing what the plan is with chemo and radiotherapy. 

I know everyone's recovery is different, but I really think she is trying to soften it for us, which I understand. Telling me to just be around on Saturday and then go back home on Sunday. I feel like this is a massive surgery, she is getting reconstruction done at the same time. I just want to be realistic and be able to take the time off work ( I live a few hours away and can't drive ) to be able to care for her. It is likely that she won't be able to do anything at all for about 4 - 6 weeks right? She is fit and healthy in general. 

Has anyone gone through this? What should I expect, obviously making food, taking care of house things that is all pretty clear to me. But other things, will she be able to move at all? Will she be able to walk up stairs? I feel like we kind of know what to expect with chemo, but I think the recovery from the surgery is going to worse than we expect.
