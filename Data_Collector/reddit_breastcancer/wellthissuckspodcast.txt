Well This Sucks
Hi everyone! I hope this post finds you all well. Last year, my best friend, Danielle, was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer at age 30. Well, we decided to create a podcast about it, and are proud to say we're 37 episodes in! It definitely serves as a coping mechanism, and we also hope that it's able to help anyone who may be going through the same thing or a similar thing or any thing. So, I wanted to share it here in hopes that it helps. Thank you so much for taking the time! https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/well-this-sucks/id1258071561?mt=2
