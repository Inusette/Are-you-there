I saw a white spot on my first mammogram
I had my first mammogram today (35) and I saw the picture pop up, and there was a big white spot in the middle, NOT smooth edges at all. It looked like it had spiderweb edges.   


I’m fully panicking and terrified.    


I do have lumpy, dense breasts. But whenever I google pictures of breast tumor on mammogram, it looks exactly like mine.   


The technician said up to 25% of all first time mammogrammed women are asked to come back for more imaging, just because they don’t have a baseline for what’s “normal for them.” She added “I’m not saying I saw anything on yours, I’m just telling you if they call you back, don’t freak out because it’s very common after your first.” 


I’ve been crying all day and I’ve
Emailed my doctor asking her if she’s gotten the mammogram results yet. I really hope I hear back from her tomorrow :( 


Absolutely nothing else I google, looks like my mammogram, except breast tumors. I’m so scared.
