Recently being diagnosed with breast cancer
Although, it is stage 1 and doctors are saying it can be treated. I don't know how to react. My family is saying it can be cured but what if it doesn't - what the tumor spreads to other parts of the body. Don't know how to react or keep my calm... it is like my life is changed... fuckkk cancerr
