Capsular contracture after radiation
I have recently had a bilateral mastectomy and tissue expanders put into place. I am worried about capsular contracture on my breast that was previously radiated. There are already spots that are indented and very hard in that breast only a few days after surgery. Is there any way to reduce this risk and/or reverse it?
