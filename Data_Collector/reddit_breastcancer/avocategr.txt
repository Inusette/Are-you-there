How hard is this going to be?
My mom told me last night that she got a diagnosis of stage 1 breast cancer, earlier this week. From what she says, it's non-invassive and not in her lymph-nodes... two tumors under 2cm. Some of the details are a little bit vague from her- apparently the appointment where they gave her the news was imediatlely following a dentist appointment where they pulled two teeth and she had had pain medications, so she was a little fuzzy on some details. Her husband absorbed enough to say "the prognosis is good" but didn't write anything down. So I'm sorry for the lack of specific details. I'll know more when I go with her to her surgical consultation next week. 
Here's my big question: I'm the oldest of three. My youngest brother has down syndrome and lives with me. Our middle brother is scheduled to move across the country at the end of May. Our mom is 65 and has been in intermittently fragile health, in the past several years...I'm a single mom of three kids 9-14 yrs old. Last night my brother asked me if he should postpone his move... he and his wife have worked really hard to save for this move and it means a lot to them, so I encouraged him to follow through with it. But the more I think about it the more I worry that our mom is going to need more than I can give, alone, and that I wont be able to support her the way she's going to need.  Should I ask my brother to stay for awhile more? I don't want to fall short for our mom by falling into the old habit of being the family martyr. 
Those who have been through treatment for stage one breast cancer or who have been through it with their loved ones- how intensive is this going to be and how much help is my mom potentially going to need? 
I'm so grateful that this was caught as early as it was. i know this could be SO much worse. But it's still scary as hell, so I appreciate any advice.
