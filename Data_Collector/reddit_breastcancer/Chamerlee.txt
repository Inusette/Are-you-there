Genetic testing
I've always known my mums grandma died of breast cancer. About 3 years ago my grandma got it (lumpectomy at 73ish) ~2 years ago my mum got it (mastectomy at 53ish). I went for genetic testing but was denied due to lack of family history.
Been to a new doctor today (to get my implant removed) and she trawled through all my history and everything and has agreed to refer me properly.
My question is, what happens during the test and what do I do if they're positive?
