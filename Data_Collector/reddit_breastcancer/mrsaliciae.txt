Should I get a second opinion?
I recently found a lump in the upper outer quadrant of my breast. I visited my normal doctor and he sent a request for me to get an ultrasound. The report from the ultrasound says " REPORT: Multiple scans of the right breast with special attention to the clinical area of interest demonstrates a very echodense fibroglandular pattern.  There is no evidence of focal solid or cystic lesions. SUMMARY: No localizing findings."  I talked to my doctor's nurse on the phone this morning and she said the only way they would take the lump out is through a cosmetic procedure which insurance wouldn't cover. I wouldn't normally get a second opinion on anything, but this months menstrual cramps were extremely painful and I usually don't get cramps. Should I go to a different doctor or possibly a gynecologist?
