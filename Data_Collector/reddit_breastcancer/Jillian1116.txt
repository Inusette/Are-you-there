Meaningful Gift for Friend - 5 years cancer free
Hi!

My friend had her 30th birthday and 5 year breast cancer anniversary in the same week. She had a celebration that I was unable to attend, but I'd like to get her something special to recognize all that she has been through or maybe even write her a letter. However, I know that sometimes people who have never gone through anything like this (me, for example) can unintentionally offend or send wrong messages. What are some things that I should or should not give/say? Should I just use my common sense?

As a point of reference - I've become close with her after she had cancer. I wasn't there with her from the beginning. Thank you for any help or advice.
