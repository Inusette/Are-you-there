Anastrozole and weird behaviors?
anyone on or know someone on anastrozole? have they had any noticeable behavioral changes? like apathy or almost pre teen behavior, rudeness in social situations, problems with memory?  asking because my aunts been acting not like her self and shes only 57 but lately its like shes 12 with the attention span of a toddler.

thanks in advance!
