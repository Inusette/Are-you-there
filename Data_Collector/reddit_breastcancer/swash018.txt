Breast Cancer Awareness School Project
Hello Everyone. I have a school Health Project with the goal of raising more awareness for Breast Cancer. Is there anyone who is willing to answer a few Questions about being diagnosed with Breast Cancer.

1. When were you diagnosed and at what age?
2. What stage were you diagnosed with?
3. How was the cancer initially detected? (i.e. through a BSE, a CBE or an annual
mammogram)
4. How did you feel when you first received the news?
5. Is there a family history of breast cancer?
6. Did you have a support network? If not, how did you overcome it or find it?
7. Tell me about your treatment process.
8. Were there any programs or services offered to you that would help with the treatment
process?
9. Did you face any obstacles during your treatment process? If so, how did you overcome
these obstacles?
10. What message would you like to provide women in the community?
