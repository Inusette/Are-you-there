How soon where you able to schedule an oncologist?
My mom had her US guided biopsy on June 20th (Wednesday) got pathology and formal diagnosis from her primary care of IDC grade 3  on the 22nd (Friday).  Primary care had us chose the oncologist on Wednesday the following week (27th).  I called the hospital to confirm receipt of referral on Friday (the 29th).  Hospital received referral told us give them a couple of days for the doctor to go over everything.  And that the hospital would call us to schedule.  I asked for a rough timeframe of when we would get that call and was told sometime late this week.

That’s our timeline so far.  She has not been sent to the surgeon or had any testing.  She only has the referral to the oncologist.  This also being July 4th week I am not holding out hope for a call this week.  My plan is to call up the hospital next Friday the 13th to ask about the status of the referral if we have not heard back from them by then. The 13th would be 3 weeks since diagnosis and 2 weeks since referral from Primary Care.

The report from her biopsy  suggested a surgical consultation as next steps.  But apparently that’s not what PCP is doing.
