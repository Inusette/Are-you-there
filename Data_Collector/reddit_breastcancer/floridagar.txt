Sister in law (30) who opted for naturopathic remedies instead of chemo now has advanced stage 4
I'm absolutely furious at these (Vancouver) "practitioners". She's been giving them thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars and is now at the point where she is missing actual appointments because her back pain is so severe. 

My wife is currently taking care of her and has been telling me some of the "treatments" they're selling her and when I look them up every one of them is dubious at best but primarily they are utter horseshit. 

A short incomplete list:
 
*photon sound wave - allegedly to "devitalize" and get her cells all on the same frequency

*vitamin drips - they take hours and cost thousands

*hyperbaric treatments - putting her in a pressurized chamber

*various "herbs and spices"

*dietary restrictions and supplements

They started a gofundme yesterday which has -amazingly- already  collected more than $10k because she's such a well loved beautiful person. I'm afraid a large part of this money will end up in the hands of these snake oil salesmen when they find out about it.

I don't know what to do but I had to leave this somewhere. Its possible they didn't do any real harm but they told her they've cured cases like hers and I'm afraid they might've caused her to allow the window for real treatment (read: actual medicine) to close as the last time she saw a real doctor they told her chemo is no longer an option when before it was "we will not do surgery until you've done chemo". 

I'm so angry I'm in tears. Is there no legislation in place to protect vulnerable patients from salesmen like this? The products they sell should require a disclaimer stating "This product will not cure cancer".

I know some people find emotional comfort in these alternative treatments, some of them might have an effect, placebos can be very powerful etc so I don't want to offend anybody.

Please just someone say something. 

Thank you.
