Breast Prosthetics
Hello current Breast Cancer patients and survivors of Reddit. I have a few questions about breast forms and prosthetics  and hoped I might have your help/opinions and advice. 
When shopping for a prosthetic, what are some materials you generally lean towards?Are you for silicone prosthetics, or poly-fiber? How easy is the process of going through your insurance to help cover the costs? Thank you in advance!
