Baseline Mammogram
Besides it being no fun, I thought absolutely nothing of it. It is just for comparison, no family history, three years of nursing babies, so on and so forth.  The follow up letter said otherwise and my mind is rocked. They scheduled me for their earliest available appt...which falls on my birthday. Can't wait. 
The letter said I have dense tissue and that they found a Focal asymmetry in one breast, microcalcifications in the other. I've read enough to understand that either of these things are likely nothing to worry about....but what about the combination of the two? Is that more damning? I'm not afraid to hear anything anyone has to say....just really want to set my mind in the direction it needs to be if I'm likely to hear bad news Thursday.
