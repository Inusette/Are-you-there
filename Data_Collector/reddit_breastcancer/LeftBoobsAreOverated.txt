Frustrated with the early process of my breast lump
I'm 30 and keep telling myself there's no way I can have breast cancer, but so many of you are so young that I feel I may be misguided about the likelihood of getting breast cancer before 50. My gyno noticed a breast lump on my left breast during my annual appointment last week. I had a mamo and ultra sound earlier today. I have a grape sized lump on my left breast on the inside of my breast. It is solid and it doesn't move or hurt, from my research all of this is bad news. 

I have a consultation with a boob Dr. scheduled for Thursday, they require the consultation before they do the biopsy which is frustrating. I really just want to get to the point and know if it's cancer or not.

I don't really know why I'm writing this or what I want from this post, but any thoughts, advice or banter is welcome.
