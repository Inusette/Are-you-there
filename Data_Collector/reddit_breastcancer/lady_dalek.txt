Breast reconstruction - implant position?
Folks who have had breast reconstruction: if you don't mind sharing, is/are your implant(s) in front of or behind the pectoral muscle? I'm deciding between two different plastic surgeons, one who prefers the more "traditional" method of going behind the muscle, and one who uses what I guess is a newer technique of putting it in front. I'd love to hear about the healing process, complications, appearance, and movement/pain, especially from very active people.

I'm leaning towards the newer technique, but since there's less documentation about it out there I'm hoping to hear from people who have personal experience with it. Thank you!!
