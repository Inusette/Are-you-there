Do your nipples stay hard?
Idk if this is the right place to post this but Idk who else to ask or where else to post this. I am post mastectomy with expanders in. I’m having a problem with my nipples &amp; idk if it’s normal or if there is something I’m supposed to be doing or that I’m doing wrong. Since the mastectomy my nipples are constantly hard &amp; never soften up and they are visible in every shirt I wear. It hurts to wear a bra with the expanders in so I bough nipple pasties just so I can wear shirts, but is this normal or do I need to look into it
