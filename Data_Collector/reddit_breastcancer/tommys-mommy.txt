My OBGYN found 4 cm lump during exam...I’m terrified.
I’m 29 and had my annual yesterday. I went in expecting a relatively quick and straightforward appt that would lead to a refill of my birth control. During the breast exam portion, I noticed my doc spending more time palpating  than usual, and when she busted out a tape measure, I knew in my gut what she was going to say next. And I didn’t actually hear much of what she had to say. My reptilian brain took over.

Here’s the little that I know:
-It is roughly 4 cm on my left breast at ~10 o’clock 
-It’s slightly tender to the touch
-No skin dimpling, nipple discharge, discoloration, or other notable symptoms
-I am scheduled for an ultrasound and bilateral mammogram in 6 days

My doc told me to not lose any sleep over it. Ha! My mind and body totally did not heed that advice. I’m terrified and struggling with the uncertainty and the waiting. This may very well be a fibroadenoma, or it may not be. I just don’t know, and I hate that I don’t know.

Any suggestions on what I can do to cope over the next couple of weeks of diagnostic procedures? How have you dealt with the waiting?
