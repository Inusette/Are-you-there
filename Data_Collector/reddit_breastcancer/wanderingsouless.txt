Hit my biopsy site and it hurts
I had a biopsy a few months ago and the pain has gone away except for some twinges every now and then. I was on a roller coaster today and hit the site hard and it brought tears to my eyes and now it’s really sore when I cough or pull with that side. I’m concerned because I have a lumpectomy in a few weeks. 

Any advice or similar experiences?
