(19 F) Found a grape sized lump right under my nipple...cancer risk?
About four years ago at the age of fifteen, I had a mobile, kidney bean sized lump in my right breast, directly underneath the skin of my right nipple that went away within a couple of weeks after I had my period. I researched the crap out of it and my findings indicated that if it goes away after a period and doesn’t come back, it’s just a hormonal issue and is nothing to worry about. Fast forward to today, I found a grape-sized, oval shaped lump in the same exact location. It’s smooth, firm, and rubbery feeling— feels exactly like a grape is under my skin and is very mobile. I don’t have any of the “classic” BC symptoms that pop up when you google it— just the lump. I don’t know if it spontaneously reappeared out of nowhere or had been growing for a while without me noticing, so naturally I panicked. I have no family history of breast cancer, nor have I ever heard of a 19 year old having breast cancer, but I’m still scared. I know the internet’s not the place for proper medical advice but I just lost my health insurance recently and I don’t know what to do. Any advice at all will be greatly appreciated
