First Mammogram - Six Benign Tumors. Should I be worried?
I am 41 years old and I went to the obgyn for a yearly exam and included with this was the first mammogram I've ever had. When you turn 40 you're supposed to get your first mammogram but I skipped my yearly pap smear last year so I didn't get a mammogram either. I didn't go because I didn't want to. I hate going to the doctor's office. They always take your blood pressure and mine is always high at the doctor's office because I hate going to any kind of doctor for any reason. 

Anyway after that, I got a phone call from the office and they had scheduled an appointment for me at a different office for additional testing.  The reason given was that I had dense tissue and no prior mammograms to compare to and I should go in and have additional screenings. So I wasn't too phased by that, and I went to that appointment without any fear.

So I found out that I have six tumors. I had to sign a form that stated that I had tumors that were probably not cancerous but I should go back in six months for more tests.

The person who reviewed my images said that the tumors I had appeared to be benign and of the sort that never metastasize.  I was also told that they'd seen a patient who had 13 of similar looking tumors and they were very reassuring. 

But I'm going back in six months.

My aunt had breast cancer and she went through a double masectomy and chemotherapy and was cleared of her breast cancer but within a year she had pancreatic cancer and that killed her.

My coworker had breast cancer and she got a masectomy and chemotherapy, and was cleared to go back to work but then she was diagnosed with leukemia, had a bone marrow transplant that was reported to be successful but then she took a sudden turn for the worse and died.  She died bald with a swollen head because her hair never grew back.

So, just curious, should I be worried about six benign tumors?
