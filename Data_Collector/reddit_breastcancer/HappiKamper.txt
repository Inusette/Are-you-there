The prostate / breast cancer link?
My Grandpa [edit: paternal] had prostate cancer (diagnosed in his mid-60s) and died at 75. My Dad was diagnosed at 57 and is currently cancer-free after getting proton therapy.

I just read a study and many articles from 2015 about women having a 14% increase in BC occurrence if they have first-degree male relatives with a young-age prostate cancer diagnosis. 

But, it's been crickets ever since.

I'm 41 and recently got my first mammo. My result was normal. With that, I planned on waiting until 45 to get my next and continue yearly through the last higher-risk age based on the latest recommendations. But, now I'm not so sure. I have no BC family history.

Why isn't a strong family history of prostate cancer part of the conversation?
