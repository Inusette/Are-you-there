How to Stay Positive
Hi everyone – My wife and I are both 36 with a 3 year old son.  My wife was recently diagnosed with breast cancer, but we don’t have any of the details yet…that will come out when we meet with the surgical oncologist on Friday.  So at this point we have no idea what stage it is or what her prognosis looks like.  We’re trying our best to stay positive and not to go down mental rabbit holes focusing on possible worst case scenarios but it’s hard.  I know some level of fear and anxiety is completely normal but at the same time, I want us both to be able to enjoy life…now and after we receive whatever the prognosis ends up being.  Really I was just wondering if you folks can share anything that has helped you stay positive and in relatively good spirits in the face of something so challenging, both in dealing with the unknowns and in facing the realities of life with cancer.
