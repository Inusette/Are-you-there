Male breast cancer??
I'm having a mild anxiety attack, which isn't like me. My wife is soundly sleeping next to me, I don't want to wake her, so I figured I'd post on reddit to find some solace. In our marriage I'm the "stay calm it will be fine" one, right now I feel anything but fine.

Over the past two weeks I've noticed a little pain under and to my right side of my nipple. Tonight I did some deep touching and noticed that there is something under the skin, almost oval shaped and slightly flat, maybe 2 inches wide and 1 inch in height. It's fairly soft, and moves around a bit. It's tender not painful. 

I'm 32, male, in decent shape, how does this happen? This is something, even if it's not cancer, something is growing. I'm not sick, I don't have any infections. It's either cancer, a benign tumor, or I'm growing a boob, like and actual boob. 

It definitely makes you rethink life decisions that's for sure. 

TL:DR 
Young male ignored mild pain for two weeks, now there is a something growing under his nipple so he is freaking out because it feels big.
