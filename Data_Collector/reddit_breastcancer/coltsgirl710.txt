Double Mastectomy on the 15th of May...advice??
Hi there!! Long time lurker, first time really posting, but could use some support. I am a 34 y/o mom of two with IDC grade 2 er+pr+ HER2 -. Getting a double mastectomy and I won't know the rest of my treatment until after that. Any advice from people that have gone through this? Anything you wish someone would have told you after the fact that would have helped recovery? 
Also wondering what my after treatment looks like... Any love or advice is appreciated!
