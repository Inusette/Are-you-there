29/M lump in breast
About 2 weeks ago I was playing on the floor with my son and noticed pain in the left part of my chest under my nipple. I immediately stood up and felt the area and found what seems to be a round mass that is sensitive to the touch. I went to the doctor and after insisting it be checked, got her to schedule a mammogram. I have hardly been able to sleep since I found it and am super nervous about my mammogram appointment tomorrow. The lymph node under the left side of jaw feels super swollen. I know I should just wait for the doctor, but I'm freaking out a bit. Are there any other symptoms with breast cancer in men? I don't have any discharge or anything. Thanks in advance.
