Mother, her mother, and her mother’s mother
They all had breast cancer and increasingly younger ages. My mom was diagnosed in her mid 40’s. After two mammograms I had a biopsy today because of a small cluster of calcification. I passed out right as he finished and then I didn’t stop bleeding for 45 minutes. I’m feeling a bunch of emotions that I’m having trouble dealing with. What helped you until you got the results? They said probably Tuesday.
