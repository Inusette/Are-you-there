Can I share your story with Women's Day?
Hello, I'm a journalist working on an assignment for Women's Day. It is to be a profile of a woman in stage four cancer who is keeping herself uplifted through work/hobbies like volunteering at a dog shelter, or the business she runs, or painting or.... you name it. As you can imagine, we are hoping to inspire all our readers. Let me know if you're interested in sharing your story and what you do to keep yourself in a positive mindset.
