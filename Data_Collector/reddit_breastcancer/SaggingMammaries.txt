Girlfriend is going to go on Arimidex, scared of the future, any alternatives?
Hi.  My GF was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer last august.  She did chemo, surgery, and radiation.   The doc is now putting her on Aromotose Inhibitor/Arimidex/Anastrazole with Lupron.  \*\*FOR SEVEN GOD DAMN YEARS\*\*  


This will force her into menopause.   Last year has been utter hell with negativity, mood swings, abusive behavior.  Is there anything else she can do?   All my research says this drug is for post menopausal women, not women who are 36.  I don't want her to be a constant bitch, call me names, and not want to do anything.  I don't want her body to change, I don't want her hair to fall out, I don't want her to gain wait, I don't want her libido to be gone (it's already been gone a fucking year).  


Is there anything else she can do instead to keep her horemones?   Anything?!   Because this fucking sucks.  I  don't want to be selfish but I don't know if I can do this.  This last year was the worst year of my life.   I am constantly miserable because she is constantly miserable.   This is not the way I wanted to live my life.  I miss being care free, her being horny, wanting to do activities, and being super active.   The way she has been the past year has been the complete opposite; it's like she's a different person.   Please don't flame me for this perspective, she has a great support network, but fuck.  This sucks.  She's supposed to be on this shit for SEVEN motherfucking years!??!?!

Fuck.
