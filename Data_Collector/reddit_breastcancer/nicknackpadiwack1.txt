A song to all those battling breast cancer
This is a cross post from /r/countrymusic but I wanted to share a song my aunt wrote as a form of empowerment to fight what you are going through or someone you know is going through:  


My aunt is currently in remission from Stage 2, invasive ductal carcinoma HER2+, breast cancer and wrote this song as a cathartic release to what she was going through. It's been so inspiring to watch her recover, rebound and use her experience to encourage &amp; support others going through similar experiences. I am beyond proud of her and wanted to share this song with ya'll, in hopes it inspires someone else. Proceeds from the stream will be used to help benefit a cancer organization (not yet chosen).  


Also for those that have been recently diagnosed or are going through a similar struggle, she's documented in enormous detail her cancer journey on her blog: [http://anitacochranmusic.com/blog/](http://anitacochranmusic.com/blog/)
