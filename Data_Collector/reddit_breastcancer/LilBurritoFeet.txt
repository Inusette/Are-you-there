New Baby and Chemo
Hey all, I'm new here. Just got diagnosed on Thursday (triple negative receptor, stage 3, right breast, 4.5cm lump, awaiting my BRCA results) and am getting a chemo port put in on Monday to start chemo very soon.

I am 31 years old, have one 15 month old son and am 24 weeks pregnant (Due 8/31/18) with a second baby. I have done some research about what's to come but I am also just trying to take everything one day at a time because my anxiety takes me to terrible places. Anyway. I was told I would start very soon on AC chemo (sorry if some of my terms are incorrect, I was at doctors office all yesterday and it was very surreal so still sorting things out). 

I was told that I would stop chemo about 6 weeks before delivery and then I would start up after the baby arrives to finish out my treatment. I have read a little bit about chemo and I know that I will not be able to breastfeed.

I was wondering about bed sharing though. I read that you have to be cautious after the chemo treatments (flushing twice, washing sheets if any bodily fluids get on it, etc) but I wondered is bed sharing allowed? Are the chemicals so intense that this might harm a newborn and/or my toddler son? I'm trying to find answers here so I can prepare myself for what's to come. I will be attending a chemo info session this coming week but I  would love to hear from women who have been through this and I guess just hear some feedback. I'm not interested in opinions about the safety of bed sharing overall, strictly about the potential affects to a newborn and potentially my toddler son. 

Also interested in any other topics that maybe I'm not thinking about in regards to doing all of this with a newborn and toddler.

Thank you all for listening :)
