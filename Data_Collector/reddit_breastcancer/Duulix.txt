Retracted nipple, dimple and pain. But I'm so, so afraid of any health workers
This is so f*cking stupid, I know. The thing is, I have some really hard experiences with the health care system. I'm afraid to go there again, to be vulnerable, and be dismissed. I know I need to go, but I just don't know how to cope. I don't know what I'm aiming for, but any help is appreciated!

Edit for clarification: My boobies have not been seen by healthcare. My bad experiences are a different can of worms.
