Trying to help my mom
Hello everyone, I am hoping you can help me, help my mamma. If this is not allowed, I apologize (please just let me know and I will promptly delete).

Almost exactly a year to the date that her mom was diagnosed with liver cancer, my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. She had a lumpectomy in February, a few days after I gave birth to my second daughter. Unfortunately the cells spread to her lymph nodes and she began chemo last week. 

To try and be there for her, while juggling a newborn, and a preschooler, has been...brutal, to say the least. Basically my husband has to take paternal leave in order for me to be able to travel the 45 min so I can physically be there for my mother and family. This means he will only receive 40% of his pay. He is the breadwinner. I have a side business, but it does not guarantee income. 

We started a GoFundMe to try and cover the financial gap, so I can help out my family while my husband cares for our eldest (she is 4). Any amount is incredibly appreciated, or even if you could just share the link, as I know not everyone is in a position to financially donate.

Another way you can help support my family, is by purchasing anything from my shop (I sell natural, handmade toys). I am in the process of making a "pink" line with special edition dinosaurs, unicorns and breast ornaments. If you do, use the code "FCANCER" for a discounted price.
