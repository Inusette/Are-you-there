Did CBD help you?
Hello,

  
Not from this sub, but I'm conducting research on people's subjective experiences ingesting CBD for breast cancer. 

* How did you ingest it?  ( Food, Tincture, Sublingual, Tablets, Vaporizing ) 
* What were the most profound effects it had for you?
* How many MG/day were you taking?
* Would you recommend CBD to others? 
* Any other useful information you'd want others to know?
