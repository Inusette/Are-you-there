44yrs old, possible fibroadenoma
44 yrs old, I had a fibroadenoma in my right breast 3.5 yrs ago, and after a biopsy they recommended taking it out because of a small chance it could be a phyllodes tumor (dr was 90% sure it was a fibroadenoma which it was). Now I have another lump on my left breast, and due to moving and new insurance I saw a different doctor on Friday. After feeling it she said it definitely feels like a fibroadenoma, ordered an ultrasound and mammogram (I just had a routine mammo 5 months ago that was clear). She said they may want to do a biopsy depending on how the ultrasound comes out. My question is, given my age and the fact that this is my 2nd lump in 3 years, why wouldn’t they do a biopsy off the bat? A mammogram and ultrasound will just confirm that the mass is there, right? I feel the mammogram is unnecessary and just want to get it biopsied. This doctor was also a bit dismissive, and said “you don’t have to get a fibrodenoma removed.” I am leaning heavily towards just taking it out given my age. 

Family history: maternal grandmother had breast cancer in her late 40’s and had a mastectomy with no return of cancer (lived to be 96). Neither my mom nor my 3 aunts have had BC so I’m not considered super high risk but I do have dense breast tissue.
