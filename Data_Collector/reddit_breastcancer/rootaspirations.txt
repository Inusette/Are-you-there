Tamoxifen for stage 2 breast cancer?
Has anyone here used or know someone who used Tamoxifen to cure/reduce their breast cancer? The Dr. just recommended it to shrink a stage 2 tumor and then to extract it for my best friend. I'm trying to gather some more information to help her out and to feel more comfortable. Thanks so much for any replies.
