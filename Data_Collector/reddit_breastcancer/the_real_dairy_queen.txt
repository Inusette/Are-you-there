Pain in one breast and hard lump: tumor vs fibrocystic breasts
Lately I have been feeling a random ache in my left breast. It actually feels kind of like when I was lactating and Iâ€™d go too long without nursing, but not quite because that was a kind of pressure and fullness and this feels more like tenderness or like I have a deep bruise. 

Last night I rolled onto that breast while in bed and it felt like I had a bouncy ball in my breast - something hard. I felt my breast and I felt a hard lump deep inside, against the muscle wall. But itâ€™s kind of lumpy in there in general? My right one doesnâ€™t feel lumpy. 

I made an appt for a mammogram and the scheduler seemed concerned when I talked about the pain and lump. She said to get a referral for a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound, not a screening mammogram. 

My husband was looking up my symptoms and stumbled upon info about fibrocystic breasts. It seems like it could be that, but I really have no idea. 

Just wondering if anyone is out there who has similar pain with a tumor or fibrocystic breasts. Really not sure whether to be terrified right now. ðŸ˜”
