MRI (step3) found benign mass and now radiologist suggests going back through mammogram (step1) and ultrasound (step2) Why repeat tests that sent me to mri in the first place..?
In 2016 (34yrs old) I had a sharp breast pain that never left. No lump could be felt, it just hurt. I gave it a few months, and no change. I went to the dr who scheduled a mammogram and an ultrasound. 

I received a letter in the mail, shortly after, informing me that I have extremely dense breasts and the results were inconclusive. I figured my physician would let me know if needed anything else, and I just moved on. 

In 2018, my mom was diagnosed with stage 0 cancer and got a lumpectomy and in a conversation she brought up the state mandated letters being sent because dense breast tissue can hide cancers. 

Uh oh.. I messed up. I should have followed up. so I make an appointment again with my provider. Pains the same, so I get an mri with contrast. 

The dr calls me 6 hours after the mri, which freaked me out. The radiologists report says benign mass found in the painful breast and to get a mammogram and ultrasound..

Why would I loop back around? What makes it benign? So many questions. My physician also wanted more information and tried to reach the radiologist but he had left for the day. So we wait.. 

In the meantime, I am just trying to figure out why if itâ€™s benign as he stated, I would need additional tests. And also why would he want to repeat the mammogram especially? 

Any insight?
