I [22F] i found a lump in my right breast 10 month ago the doctors said it was fibroadenoma but decided to take it out now i found another lump
The title says it all, i'm quite new to reddit and i never thought i would have to be worried about a topic like this:(
My grandmothers from both sides had a history of cancer one of them had a really bad type of breast cancer, but i don't know many details as i'm not close with my family.

I'm 22 but not sure how age effects my chances. I will have a surgery because of the fibroadenoma in my right breast next week. Doctors in my country doesn't really tell me anything, and i don't know anyone who has similar experiences. Should i be worried as i found another lump but this case its under my jaw and it actually hurts more than the one in my breast?

Also, what impact will these things have on my future? Where should i start actual research in this topic to try to prevent something more serious? I honestly feel so lost and have been just ignoring it but i really wanna do my best.
